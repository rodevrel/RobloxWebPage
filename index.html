              <p>In August 1989, David Baszucki founded Knowledge Revolution, a company which concentrated on educational physics and mechanical simulation software. There, he wrote a general-purpose physics simulator called Interactive Physics. He was the president of Knowledge Revolution until December 1998 and during this time has been joined first by Erik Cassel, then in 1997 by Keith Lucas. <br>

              </div>

              

              Knowledge Revolution was acquired for $20 million in January 1999 by MSC Software Corporation, for which David Baszucki served as vice president until he left with Erik Cassel to create ROBLOX, in 2004. They were soon joined by other employees of MSC Software.
              The first url, GoBlocks.com was purchased on December 2, 2003 and was renamed Dynablocks.com from December 12, 2003 to January 30, 2004. <br> <br>
  
              Roblox was created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in the year of 2004. Its beta version, Dynablocks, was launched in 2004. It was renamed to Roblox in 2005 due to the name being hard to remember. During this time, it was also called Roblox v.10 according to DomainTools Screenshots. The website came out of beta and was officially launched in 2006.<br> <br> <br>

            <div class="col-lg">
              <p>The original currency, Roblox points, could be earned by logging in daily or by playing minigames. Features added in 2006 and 2007 included private messages, the search bar, and avatar customization. <br> <br>

              Roblox badges were added on December 22, 2006. In March 2007, Roblox became compliant with COPPA, with the addition of safe chat, a chat mode which limited users under the age of thirteen to communicating by selecting predefined messages from a menu. <br> <br>

              Roblox Points  were replaced by Robux, introduced on May 14, 2007. A new currency, tickets, was introduced in August 2007, and a premium membership, the Builders Club, became available on August 16, 2007. <br> <br> <br>

            <div class="col-lg">
              <p>The first Roblox convention, the Roblox Rally 2011 was held in San Francisco on August 1, 2011. A similar event called the Roblox Game Conference 2012 was held in 2012. The subsequent BLOXcon 2013 was held in Chicago, London, and New York, then completed by the Virtual BLOXcon 2013 which could be watched through a live stream. <br> <br>

              On April 1, 2012, the site was compromised which enabled an unknown individual to vandalize the website. Banners were added to the site which displayed offensive content such as: "thank you minish for messing up the economy. nub." and "Haha these are so funny let's go spam the forums about them :D". Countless other banners with offensive content were also added. Some users were given Large quantities of ROBUX, and several users were compromised most notable being 1dev2. ROBLOX then responded by taking the site down for maintenance in order to resolve the issues with the site. <br> <br>
                
              The site returned on April 2 and on sometime around April 4th all users who were involved in the hacking were terminated and IP banned.
              A trading system allowing users to trade limited and limited unique items was enabled for all premium members on July 12, 2012. <br> <br>

              On December 11, 2012, Roblox started supporting mobile devices. <br> <br> <br>

              <p>On February 11, 2013, co-founder Erik Cassel passed away after his battle with cancer. <br> <br>

              On September 24, 2013, Roblox established a price floor for clothing in the catalog. The minimum price to sell a T-shirt was set to 10 Robux and the minimum price to sell shirts or pants was set to 20 Robux (or 120 tickets). <br> <br>
                
              The Developer Exchange program was released on October 1, 2013. This program allows developers with Outrageous Builders Club membership to earn money by exchanging Robux. <br> <br>
                
              On March 15, 2016, David Baszucki announced that tickets would be discontinued after thirty days. During the thirty days before they were removed, items that could only be bought with tickets were released. Tickets were removed on April 14, 2016, at the same time as the Trade Currency system which allowed trading of both currencies. <br> <br>
                
              A text filtering feature using the Community Sift service replaced the safe chat menu in 2016. This allows users under the age of thirteen to create content on the website and to use messages in games that are not predefined. <br> <br> <br>
